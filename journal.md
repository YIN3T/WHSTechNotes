3 sensors found on the Sphero BOLT are:
-Accelerometer (Detects motion and orientation.)
-Gyroscope (Measures Rotation and angular velocity)
-Light sensor- (Detects ambient light levels)
The light sensor on the Sphero BOLT measures ambient light levels, allowing the robot to detect a change in its environment. It works by converting light into an electrical signal that the robot can interpret. This sensor helps the BOLT operate by enabling it to respond to light conditions- such as stopping when it enters a dark area or changing color in response to brightness. For example, in a maze challenge, the BOLT could use the light sensor to detect a brightly lit exit and navigate toward it, demonstrating its ability to interact with its surroundings based on light data.

I think the instructions were perefectly fine, and the setup was clear. I believe the problem wasn't nothing with the directions but with the people not following them properly. Maybe just emphasize more that if they keep doing it wrong, they'll continue getting a zero every week. That might make everyone pay more attention and do it correctly. I personally didn't encounter any challeneges while folloiwng the direct instructions.

Today, using the website of HourofCode I completeted the assignment Codesters: Turtle Traffic! it ranges from grades Grades 6-8 introducing a beginner level of Python. The description goes the lines along of
"Learn the basics of coding in Python while creating your own turtle-crossing game! Use lists and loops to set up your game, and events to create cars and control the turtle! Can you safely cross the road?"
honestly it said grades 6-8, but it seemed harder.

Following instructions exactly is really important when learning to code. Even a tiny mistake, like missing a semicolon, can make a program not work at all. For example, if you forget to define a variable the program will crash. Paying attention to details early on helps you do better with harder projects later. In the end, being precise leads to success and makes you feel more confident in coding.

One task where computer science affects my daily life is using messaging apps like instagram or Imessage to talk to friends. These apps are created through coding and programming, which allow messages to be sent quickly and safely. WIthout computer science, I wouldn't be able to communicate instantly with others, making it harder to stay connected and share information. My day would be much more difficult wihtout this easy and fast way to chat with people.

Artifical Intelligence, also known as AI, is changing many areas in life. In healthcare, Ai can help doctors analyze medical images quickly, which improves patient care. In education, it creates personalized learning experiences for the students. Self driving cars also use AI to make transporation safer. However, there are some risk factors that come along with the addition of Ai aswell. Job automation may leave some people without jobs, and bias in AI can lead to unfair descisions in hiring or law enforcement. Additionaly, Ai systems can be hacked, risking the leakage of personal information. While AI has great benefits, we also must be aware that it has its challenges aswell.

Protecting personal and sensitive information online is very important. It helps prevent identity theft and cyberbullying. To keep my data safe on sites like Github or social media, I can use strong passswords and turn on two factor authentication. I once shared a photo that showed my schools name, and I realized it was too personal. Now, I would think carefully before posting anything that reveals too much about me. Being cautious online protects my reputation and safety now and in the future.

Technology has changed how we grow, move, and buy food, especially during the holidays. Machines like tractors and harvesters make farming faster and cheaper, so food costs less. Refrigerated trucks and tracking systems keep food fresh and get it to stores quickly. Online shopping and delivery apps make it easy to buy food without leaving home. But there are some problems, like fewer jobs because of machines or big delays if the systems break down. For example, if a truck breaks down, food might not get to the store in time. Technology helps a lot, but it’s not perfect.

I researched OpenAI’s progress in natural language processing (NLP). This technology helps computers understand and generate human language, improving tools like ChatGPT. It could make daily life easier by assisting with communication and research. In my future career, I could use it to build smarter applications for education or business. However, ethical issues like privacy and bias need to be carefully addressed.

The term “brain rot” makes me think about how too much time online can hurt your focus and mental health. Digital media has been both good and bad for me this year—it’s fun and helpful, but it can feel like a waste when I spend too much time scrolling. I’ve seen a lot of “slop” online, like low-quality posts, but I also enjoy creative content, like “lore,” which keeps stories and ideas alive. I think it’s possible to use technology in a good way by setting limits and focusing on things that really matter. If we are careful, we can enjoy the benefits of being online without letting it take over our lives.

1.Government intervention can affect companies like Tiktok. They might change how they work. Users might lose access to apps they enjoy, causing frustation and confusion. To solve security concerns, TikTok could store data in each country instead of sharing it globally. This would make governments and users feel safer about their information.

2. If I were a developer, I'd add a feature that shows users what data is collected and lets them control it. This would build trust and improve privacy. In class, we learned how important data privacy is in app development. This situtation reminds me to always think about secuirty when working on projects. Keeping user data safe is key to making successful apps.

1.Air traffic control systems can help plane avoid crashes by tracking their locations. Sometimes, software errors or old systems can cause mistakes. IF ATC had better software it could fine problems faster. Autopilot and warning systems also help pilots react quickly. These improvements could prevent accidents like the recent collision.

2.Cybersecuirty is important because hackers could attack planes or air traffic systems. If someone messes witht he signals, pilots could get the wrong info. Stronger security can stop hackers from causing problems. Also software can study past crashes to find risks. Fixing these issues can make flying safer for everyone.

1.Technology can help educators keep up with slang through AI tools, online dictionaries, and social media tracking. Apps and chatbots could include slang translation features, making it easer to understand students. However, slang changes fast, so these tools need frequent updates. Misinterpreations can also happen if words have multiple meanings. This could unfourantely cause probelms amongst individuals.
   
  2.Adding slang translation to educational apps could help communcation but also cause issues. Some slang isn't school appropriate, and overusing it might make adults seem out of touch. Schools shouldnt formally teach slang, but they can encourage open discussions to improve understanding. Misunderstanding slang can lead to confusion, frustration, or miscommuncation in schools and counseling. Again, better understanding can also stop conflict.

1.Last Friday, our class had a substitute teacher, and while most of behaved well, there were a few issues. One student walked out without permission, which likely made the substitute feel disrespected and unsure of how to handel the situation. THroughout the day, the teacher had to repeatedly remind us to stay quiet and remain seated. Despite this, the majority of the class followed the instructions ad stayed on task, making the substitute's job easier. However, the disruptions from a few students may have made the day more stressful fo the teacher.

  2.If i could change anything, I would encourage veryone to listen the first time a teacher gives a direction. That way, they wouldn't have to constantly remind us to behave. Moving foward, i can personally set a  good exampleby staying in my seat, lsitening, and helping others stay focused. When a substitue comes in, thye should feel respected and welcomed, and as a class, we should make their job as easy as possible.

1.Over Spring break I used technology mainly for entertainmeent and communcation. I spent a lot of time on Tiktok and Instagram, watching videos and scrolling through posts. Tiktok kept me entertained with short funny clips, while instagram helped me stayed updated on what my friends were doing. Both apps made it easy to send messages, share posts, and interact with others. They were a fun way to pass time and stay connected with people, even when I wasn't seeing them in person.

  2. These apps also relate to what we learn in Computer science. For example Tiktok and Instagram used algorithims to show content based on user preferences, which connects to coding and data proccessing. I also noticed how app features like filters and effects rely on programming in order to work smoothly. Understanding how these apps function can help with learning about app development and user interface design. These concepts relate to problem-solving and coding which are extremly important skills when it comes to computer science.
