Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

3 sensors found on the Sphero BOLT are:
-Accelerometer (Detects motion and orientation.)
-Gyroscope (Measures Rotation and angular velocity)
-Light sensor- (Detects ambient light levels)
The light sensor on the Sphero BOLT measures ambient light levels, allowing the robot to detect a change in its environment. It works by converting light into an electrical signal that the robot can interpret. This sensor helps the BOLT operate by enabling it to respond to light conditions- such as stopping when it enters a dark area or changing color in response to brightness. For example, in a maze challenge, the BOLT could use the light sensor to detect a brightly lit exit and navigate toward it, demonstrating its ability to interact with its surroundings based on light data.

I think the instructions were perefectly fine, and the setup was clear. I believe the problem wasn't nothing with the directions but with the people not following them properly. Maybe just emphasize more that if they keep doing it wrong, they'll continue getting a zero every week. That might make everyone pay more attention and do it correctly. I personally didn't encounter any challeneges while folloiwng the direct instructions.

Today, using the website of HourofCode I completeted the assignment Codesters: Turtle Traffic! it ranges from grades Grades 6-8 introducing a beginner level of Python. The description goes the lines along of
"Learn the basics of coding in Python while creating your own turtle-crossing game! Use lists and loops to set up your game, and events to create cars and control the turtle! Can you safely cross the road?"
honestly it said grades 6-8, but it seemed harder.
