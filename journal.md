Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

3 sensors found on the Sphero BOLT are:
-Accelerometer (Detects motion and orientation.)
-Gyroscope (Measures Rotation and angular velocity)
-Light sensor- (Detects ambient light levels)
The light sensor on the Sphero BOLT measures ambient light levels, allowing the robot to detect a change in its environment. It works by converting light into an electrical signal that the robot can interpret. This sensor helps the BOLT operate by enabling it to respond to light conditions- such as stopping when it enters a dark area or changing color in response to brightness. For example, in a maze challenge, the BOLT could use the light sensor to detect a brightly lit exit and navigate toward it, demonstrating its ability to interact with its surroundings based on light data.
