3 sensors found on the Sphero BOLT are:
-Accelerometer (Detects motion and orientation.)
-Gyroscope (Measures Rotation and angular velocity)
-Light sensor- (Detects ambient light levels)
The light sensor on the Sphero BOLT measures ambient light levels, allowing the robot to detect a change in its environment. It works by converting light into an electrical signal that the robot can interpret. This sensor helps the BOLT operate by enabling it to respond to light conditions- such as stopping when it enters a dark area or changing color in response to brightness. For example, in a maze challenge, the BOLT could use the light sensor to detect a brightly lit exit and navigate toward it, demonstrating its ability to interact with its surroundings based on light data.

I think the instructions were perefectly fine, and the setup was clear. I believe the problem wasn't nothing with the directions but with the people not following them properly. Maybe just emphasize more that if they keep doing it wrong, they'll continue getting a zero every week. That might make everyone pay more attention and do it correctly. I personally didn't encounter any challeneges while folloiwng the direct instructions.

Today, using the website of HourofCode I completeted the assignment Codesters: Turtle Traffic! it ranges from grades Grades 6-8 introducing a beginner level of Python. The description goes the lines along of
"Learn the basics of coding in Python while creating your own turtle-crossing game! Use lists and loops to set up your game, and events to create cars and control the turtle! Can you safely cross the road?"
honestly it said grades 6-8, but it seemed harder.

Following instructions exactly is really important when learning to code. Even a tiny mistake, like missing a semicolon, can make a program not work at all. For example, if you forget to define a variable the program will crash. Paying attention to details early on helps you do better with harder projects later. In the end, being precise leads to success and makes you feel more confident in coding.

One task where computer science affects my daily life is using messaging apps like instagram or Imessage to talk to friends. These apps are created through coding and programming, which allow messages to be sent quickly and safely. WIthout computer science, I wouldn't be able to communicate instantly with others, making it harder to stay connected and share information. My day would be much more difficult wihtout this easy and fast way to chat with people.

1. Coding helps you break big tasks into smaller steps, making it easier to solve problems. For example, in business, coding could help you organize customer data more efficiently.
2. In healthcare, coding could help doctors analyze patient data faster. In education, teachers could create tools to track student progress. Coding skills let you adapt to the digitial tools in these fields.
3. Coding allows you to create new apps or programs, which is creative. In collaboration, you can team up with others to develop better solutions, like a finance expert working with a coder to build a budgeting tool.
4. Doctors can develop patient care apps, and teachers can make interactive learning tools. Coding could help me in my future career by letting me create tools to solve problems, even if im not in tech directy.

Artifical Intelligence, also known as AI, is changing many areas in life. In healthcare, Ai can help doctors analyze medical images quickly, which improves patient care. In education, it creates personalized learning experiences for the students. Self driving cars also use AI to make transporation safer. However, there are some risk factors that come along with the addition of Ai aswell. Job automation may leave some people without jobs, and bias in AI can lead to unfair descisions in hiring or law enforcement. Additionaly, Ai systems can be hacked, risking the leakage of personal information. While AI has great benefits, we also must be aware that it has its challenges aswell.

Computer science and technology can play a huge role in elections today. Voting machines and online registation making voting faster and easier. For example, touch-screen voting helps people cast votes in quickly and reduces mistakes. However, relying on technology also brings risks, like hacking. If systems arent secure, hackers could change vote counts or steal information, so strong security and regular checks are essential to keep elections safe.

Protecting personal and sensitive information online is very important. It helps prevent identity theft and cyberbullying. To keep my data safe on sites like Github or social media, I can use strong passswords and turn on two factor authentication. I once shared a photo that showed my schools name, and I realized it was too personal. Now, I would think carefully before posting anything that reveals too much about me. Being cautious online protects my reputation and safety now and in the future.

The U.S presidential election is happening right now, and people are choosing who will be the next president. There's a lot of talk about important issues like the economy and healthcare. Technology is a big part of this, as campaigns use social media and data to reach voters, and voting itself uses technology to keep things organized and secure.
In the future, computer scicene could make elections even safer and easier.Better security could stop hackers from messing with voting systems. New techonlogy like blockchain could help make sure votes are counted fairly. AI could also help campaigns understand voters better and make it easier for people to vote.

Technology has changed how we grow, move, and buy food, especially during the holidays. Machines like tractors and harvesters make farming faster and cheaper, so food costs less. Refrigerated trucks and tracking systems keep food fresh and get it to stores quickly. Online shopping and delivery apps make it easy to buy food without leaving home. But there are some problems, like fewer jobs because of machines or big delays if the systems break down. For example, if a truck breaks down, food might not get to the store in time. Technology helps a lot, but it’s not perfect.

I researched OpenAI’s progress in natural language processing (NLP). This technology helps computers understand and generate human language, improving tools like ChatGPT. It could make daily life easier by assisting with communication and research. In my future career, I could use it to build smarter applications for education or business. However, ethical issues like privacy and bias need to be carefully addressed.

The term “brain rot” makes me think about how too much time online can hurt your focus and mental health. Digital media has been both good and bad for me this year—it’s fun and helpful, but it can feel like a waste when I spend too much time scrolling. I’ve seen a lot of “slop” online, like low-quality posts, but I also enjoy creative content, like “lore,” which keeps stories and ideas alive. I think it’s possible to use technology in a good way by setting limits and focusing on things that really matter. If we are careful, we can enjoy the benefits of being online without letting it take over our lives.

Looking Back: I enjoyed learning coding and working on projects that semester.
Looking ahead: I would like to learn more about cybersecuirty and how to protect systems
Certifcations: I am interested in a Python certification and would like more pratice exercises to prepare.
